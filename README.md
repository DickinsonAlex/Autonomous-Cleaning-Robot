# Autonomous Cleaning Robot â€“ "TidyBot" Project

This project contains scripts to autonomously control a cleaning robot named TidyBot, built using Python and ROSâ€¯2. TidyBot operates in a simulated environment, where it detects, sorts, and organizes colored cubes by matching them to color-coded markers and pushing them into position using camera and LiDAR data.

âœ… Core Features:
- DevContainer-enabled ROSâ€¯2 workspace for seamless development and simulation
- Main control script for real-time navigation and object interaction
- Multi-sensor fusion using camera and LiDAR
- Collision avoidance and path planning
- Task scheduling and automated return-to-base behavior

ðŸ§  Enhancements:
- Live Debugging UI: Visual map of the botâ€™s environment, object positions, and movement history
- Simulation Tools: Scripts included for launching the simulation and testing new tasks

ðŸ§ª Technical Skills:
Python â€¢ ROSâ€¯2 â€¢ LiDAR â€¢ Computer Vision â€¢ Autonomous Robotics â€¢ DevContainers

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Container Setup:**
   Once reopened in the container, VSCode will initiate the building process and pull all necessary dependencies. You can monitor the building log within VSCode. This may take a while (in particular if you have not previouly used the computer with the container), as you entire image with all installations is being pulled.

2. **Verify Container Environment:**
   After the build completes, VSCode will connect to the container. You can verify that you are within the container environment.

   You can now open the virtual desktop (see next section) or a terminal in VSCode inside the DevContainer:

### Devcontainer Features

The devcontainer includes a virtual 3D accelerated (if the host has an NVIDIA GPU and docker runtime installed) desktop.

1. **Accessing the Desktop Interface:**
   Open the user interface by navigating to the `PORTS` tab in VSCode, selected the URL labeled `desktop` to open it in your browser. You can also right-click on the URL it and choose "Preview in Editor" to have that desktop shown directly in VSCode, instead.

2. **Complete the connection:**
   Click on "Connect".

   Your desktop will open. If you want the size of this virtual desktop to adjust automatically to your browser window, choose "Remote Resizing" in the options on the left hand side.
